This game works like a pretty standard text-based adventure.
Type "help" to get a list of all available commands, and usages.
Type a cardinal direction to go there.
There is a puzzle you must complete to unlock the mysterious door.
Perhaps the robot can be of assistance?
The game will end either when the timer runs out and the world implodes,
or the player finds their way through the gate.
